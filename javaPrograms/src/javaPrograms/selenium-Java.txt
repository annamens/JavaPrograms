What is s/w testing?
Testing the software before going into production.

Manual testing:
As per requirements we write test cases and execute them accordingly.

Functional Testing: Behaviour of application.

Re-testing:Testing again and again with multiple sets of data.
Regression:Re-validating the defects in the newer builds and because of them , there are no side effects
We have already tested the build but because of that, it should not effect others.so, we need to test others

Automation: Once automated a test case, we can execute the test n number of times.
Automation came into picture because of re-testing and regression testing.
